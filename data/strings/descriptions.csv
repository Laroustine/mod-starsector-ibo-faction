teiwaz,FACTION,"Teiwaz is Jupiter's biggest conglomerate, which represents the Outer Sphere. It has countless corporate affiliates and its vast range of activities encompasses heavy industry, manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, financing, medical care, education, agriculture, private military work, and transportation. The organization is also rumored to be run like a mafia.",,,
gjallarhorn,FACTION,"Gjallarhorn is a peacekeeping organization established by Agnika Kaieru and the nations of Earth, and its origin can be traced back to the Calamity War era. To prevent humanity from facing extinction due to the Calamity War, a group of like-minded individuals from across all nations and power blocs gathered together to end the fighting. To that end, they developed the Alaya Vijnana System and the Gundam Frames to possess the decisive edge necessary to end the war. Gjallarhorn successfully ended the Calamity War and used their military power to maintain peace, and keep an independent eye on the four economic blocs.",,,

orbital_station_saisei,CUSTOM,"This is the Saisei, it is the Large Planetary Cruiser owned by Teiwaz. It is a huge ship and the heart of Teiwaz.",,,,
station_gjallarhorn,CUSTOM,"This is a Gjallarhorn administrative station. It is the nicer way of putting the fact that they patrol the sector to harass anyone.",,,,
,,,,,,
halfbeack,SHIP,"The Halfbeak-class is the main battleship of the Gjallarhorn space fleet. It is equipped with an Ahab Reactor and Nanolaminate Armor. During combat, the ship's bridge can retract into the body. The mobile suits are launched from a catapult mounted under the ship, and return through a rear hatch.",,,,

graze_custom,SHIP,"Created from the captured Graze units. The Graze is a state of the art mobile suit series built by Gjallarhorn and deployed within the Earth Sphere and space. It is developed based on the Calamity War era mobile suit, V08-1228 Grimgerde and its Valkyrja Frame. An excellent machine with low development and operational cost, the Graze is said to be the culmination of current technology.

The machine's frame was carefully designed for general purpose use, and through exchanging armaments and armor, it can adapt to various environments as well as use various loadouts to meet the needs of different mission. The frame was also developed to be lighter and simpler; compared to the Gundam Frame that represents Calamity War era MS, the Graze’s frame is made using much lesser structural material.",,,
rodi_man,SHIP,"The Man Rodi is the main short-to-middle range combat mobile suit. It is a restored machine that uses the Rodi frame. Many mobile suits using this frame were mass produced during the middle period of the Calamity War, and served as the main units in the Outer Sphere for many years. As the Rodi frame does not have a defining characteristic feature, it also does not have much drawbacks either and is thus considered to be very versatile. Due to its versatility, it's able to support heavy armor and Man Rodi is loaded with such until its maximum weight capacity. The Man Rodi is customized primarily for space as its heavy armor would be a huge burden under gravity.",,,
rodi_landman,SHIP,"Some Man Rodis used by the space pirates Brewers were modified for ground use after being captured, and they were eventually deployed to Tekkadan's Earth branch. Since it's equipped with the Alaya-Vijnana System, it can display its full mobility under Earth's gravity and Mars's. The Landman Rodi's legs use high class parts, unlike the low cost space-use version of the Man Rodi, hence the suit is also capable of operating in space without any issue.",,,

ryusei_go,SHIP,"An upgrade of the Graze Custom, equipment and technology from Teiwaz were used on the Mobile Suit. As a result, the suit now has shoulders and rear skirt armor derived from Teiwaz's Hyakuren, and although its weight increased, the new parts also grants it tougher armor and better attitude/posture control. Parts for attaching the Kutan Type-III's small side arm armor to the suit's legs were also incorporated. The small side arm armor helps to increase the Ryusei-Go's thrust, and gives its excellent performance in orbital combat despite the pull of gravity. The Ryusei-Go can also use the Kutan Type-III the standard way, with the small side arm armor still attached to the transport craft/booster.

The suit's control system has been changed as well, it is now connected to the Alaya-Vijnana System which is salvaged from a Man Rodi.",,,
mobile_worker,SHIP,It is a space-use version of the ground-use TK-53 CGS Mobile Worker. Space activity was made possible due to the installation of a propellant tank and replacement of the ground-use wheels with vernier nozzles.,,,
shiden,SHIP,"A mass production, general purpose model developed by Teiwaz based on the technology accumulated from the development of the Hyakuri and Hyakuren. The Shiden's Io Frame was designed from scratch, but as it shares the same design philosophy as the Hyakuri and Hyakuren's Teiwaz Frame, the two appear to be sister machines even to great technicians. Although the Io frame uses Ahab Reactor from the Calamity War era that was recovered from the Debris Zone, it is still extremely valuable as it uses the latest technology in the crafting of its frame material to its design and development.",,,
shiden_custom,SHIP,A customized Shiden Mobile Suit with a shield shoulder mount and a modified single horn faceplate.,,,
graze_dainsleif,SHIP,"A Graze unit equipped with a Dáinsleif railgun mounted in place of it's left arm. A railgun modified to fire special projectiles made from the rare alloy used on mobile suit frames due to the use of superior mechanism, and during the Calamity War, they were heavily used as weapons that could even pierce nanolaminate armor.",,,
isaribi,SHIP,"An Armored Assault ship usually found with independant merchants or mercenaries, it's main purpose is typically for light combat encounters or escort. It comes equipped with two fixed auto-cannons on the port and starboard, as well as two torpedo tubes in the front of the ship. At the bottom of the ship is a cargo hold mainly used to send out fighter craft.",,,
shiden_ryusei,SHIP,"A customized Shiden Mobile Suit with a shield shoulder mount. This is a Shiden customized for Norba Shino's use, and at his request, shoulder thrusters were added and a gauntlet is equipped as part of its standard equipment.",,,
