Alaya-Vijnana System,av_system,0,,Gjallarhorn,special,,100,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.AlayaVijnanaSystem,"The Alaya-Vijnana System creates a pseudo-brain lobe in the pilot's body using nano-machines, and this allows the pilot's brain to directly process mobile suit data fed through the physical connection. As the pseudo-brain lobe also governs spatial awareness so the pilot's spatial awareness is enhanced.
